Main project for COMP2550 Sem1 2013 - Jimmy and Chris

This will focus on salient object detection - further details TBA

At the moment, the framework contains only a skeleton implementation (it probably
doesn't even compile yet), copied from the COMP3130warmup project code to be
refactored into something that is useable for salient object detection.
